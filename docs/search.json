    "text": "Assessment Process Report Summary\nThe SEDAR 84 Puerto Rico Yellowtail Snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus) stock assessment process consisted of four webinars between April 2024 and October 2024. The data available for the assessment included:\n\nAn annual species-specific catch time series from commercial logbooks\nFishery-dependent length compositions from commercial port sampling\nFishery-independent length compositions from a reef fish survey\nFishery-independent indices of abundance from a reef fish survey\nLife history information from otolith analysis and gonad histology\n\nThe assessment used Stock Synthesis, a statistical catch-at-age model (Methot et al., 2020). Stock Synthesis V3.30.22 models were initially configured with an annual catch time series, while length composition data from each source were aggregated across all available years. Model development proceeded stepwise from the simplest configuration to those of moderate complexity. Those sequential steps included the inclusion of dome-shaped selectivity, indices of abundance, and annual length compositions. Models were run with and without the estimation of recruitment deviations. Finally, sensitivities of assessment outcomes were investigated using alternative inputs for longevity-informed natural mortality, coefficient of variation on growth, and uncertainty on initial equilibrium catch.\nModel diagnostics assessed convergence, fit, and consistency using gradients, residuals, likelihood profiles, hindcast cross-validation, and jitter analyses. Those diagnostics revealed that, although data contrast was limited and recruitment estimates were highly uncertain, the available length and catch data—particularly from fishery-independent sources—provided information that the models can use to determine potential catch advice, particularly in a grid or model ensemble approach that accounts for key model assumptions and data-limited caveats.\nSensitivity analyses evaluated the effects of assumptions about natural mortality, growth variability, and initial equilibrium catch conditions. While these scenarios showed that key uncertainties can influence estimated productivity and biological reference points, nearly all models across the suite supported the conclusion that overfishing is not occurring and the stock is not overfished. A few sensitivity runs did indicate potential concern under specific combinations of assumptions, particularly with lower initial equilibrium catch and higher natural mortality.\n\n\n\n\nMethot, R.

    "text": "2.1.1 Catch\nThe catch data for the commercial fleet came from the Caribbean Commercial Logbook program (Martínez Rivera et al., 2024). Commercial fishery landings data for Yellowtail Snapper in Puerto Rico were available for the years 1983-2022.\nThe handline gear group made up 80% of the reported landings catch of Yellowtail Snapper in Puerto Rico from this group. All gears (handline, trap, rod and reel, and other) were included into a single commercial fleet (Table 7.1). Potential outliers discussed during the assessment webinars were investigated and retained as valid trips.\nIn the SEDAR 84 Stock Synthesis models, the catch was input as biomass (in metric tons) and was treated as if it occurred over an entire fishing season; i.e., each fishing year.\nThe years of the available species-specific self-reported commercial fisher logbook landings and effort data determined the start and end years of the Stock Synthesis models. The start and end years of the model were 1983 and 2022, respectively.\nIt is important to note that the stock was not unexploited at the start year of the available catch time series. Therefore, initial F was estimated for the commercial fleet and a corresponding initial equilibrium catch was input. A common method was use to define an initial equilibrium catch. It was equal to the geometric mean of the first three years of available catches (168.3 metric tons).\nThe input standard error for the landings was set to 0.3. When implemented with few data inputs, Stock synthesis will inherently fit the annual landings time series nearly exactly, regardless of the input standard error. Initial models were set up with a default standard error of 0.01. In addition to nearly exactly fitting the annual landings time series, the models also nearly exactly fit the input initial equilibrium catch. A higher standard error value of 0.3 was used to free up the estimation of the initial equilibrium catch. The sequential model configurations and model development are described later in this report.\nCommercial discards are not reported in Puerto Rico fisher logbook data. The assessment assumed no discards.\nAlternative model configurations associated with the commercial fleet data are described later in this report. They included:\n\nThe initial equilibrium catch was explored via likelihood profiling.\nA higher standard error of 2 was explored via sensitivity analysis.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Size Composition\nGear-specific annual length frequencies for the commercial fleet came from the commercial shore-based port-sampling Trip Interview Program (Godwin et al., 2024). The NOAA Fisheries, Southeast Fisheries Science Center Trip Interview Program collects length and weight data from fish landed by commercial fishing vessels, along with information about fishing areas and gears. Data collection began in 1983 with frequent updates in best practices; the latest being in 2017. The Yellowtail Snapper length data from Puerto Rico included 103,730 length observations across 5,159 unique port sampling interviews.\nAlthough the catch data can be separated into handline and non-handline related gears, 77% of the length measurements for Puerto Rico Yellowtail Snapper from 1983-2022 were associated with handlines. Those data were used to characterize the commercial fleet’s size-based selectivity pattern. Since multiple fish length measurements can be obtained from a single sampled trip, each length does not represent an independent observation. The relative model weighting of the commercial fleet length compositions was based on the number of trips sampled.\nFrom 1983 - 2022, the size data included 83,341 shore-based length measurements obtained across 2,829 trips. The Trip Interview Program length compositions of the commercial fleet were assumed to be representative of the total catch.\nA double normal function was used to model the relative vulnerability of capture by length for the commercial fleet. However, only two parameters were estimated, effectively describing a logistic selectivity for the commercial fleet. The double normal function allows for domed or logistic selectivity. It combines two normal distributions; the first describes the ascending limb, while the second describes the descending limb. Achieving the logistic shape with the double normal Stock Synthesis pattern facilitated model configurations for SEDAR 84. The two parameters used to achieve a logistic selectivity shape were the size associated with peak selectivity and the width of the ascending limb. Domed selectivity was explored for the fishery independent survey data described in the following section.",

    "section": "2.2 Survey Data",
    "text": "2.2 Survey Data\n\n2.2.1 Index of Abundance\nThe National Coral Reef Monitoring Program (NCRMP) supports reef fish sampling on hard-bottom habitats from 0 to 30 meters depth (Grove et al., 2021). In Puerto Rico, NCRMP sampling began in 2001 and was conducted every year from 2001 to 2012 and then 2014, 2016, 2019, and 2021. The data used in SEDAR 84 were from 2014 - 2022 when the survey was conducted island-wide. Data collected prior to 2017 were calibrated to account for a transition from belt transect to a cylinder survey method.\nAnnual mean density and associated standard errors for NCRMP for SEDAR 84 were provided by Grove et al. (2024). In Stock Synthesis, the time series of mean density across all observed sizes were input as an index in numbers with a lognormal error distribution. The associated length composition data, described in the following subsection, suggested that the index reflected the abundance of juveniles but did not observe the larger adults concurrently observed in the commercial catch data.\n\n\n2.2.2 Size Composition\nThe NCRMP survey in Puerto Rico provided counts by individual lengths measured to the nearest centimeter. The length data inputs for both the commercial fleet and the surveys were used 3-centimeter bins.\nSince multiple fish can be observed during a single dive, individual lengths are not independent observations. The relative model weighting of the NCRMP survey and DCRMP survey length compositions across years was based on the number of paired dives.\nThe length compositions provided reasonable support that younger fish were available to the NCRMP survey. Over half of the lengths from the NCRMP survey were smaller than 20 centimeters fork length, and 99% were below 33 centimeters fork length. Dome-shaped selectivity was explored for the NCRMP survey.\nModels were initially configured in Stock Synthesis with length compositions aggregated across the available years for each source of length data and proceeded stepwise from the simplest configuration to those of moderate complexity. The steps included the inclusion of annual fishery-independent length compositions. The sequential model configurations are described later in this report.",

    "section": "2.3 Life History Data",
    "text": "2.3 Life History Data\nThe life history data used in the assessment included longevity-informed natural mortality, growth, length-weight, and maturity analyzed from 1,554 samples of Yellowtail Snapper collected across the U.S. Caribbean from 2013 to 2023 (Shervette et al., 2024). The largest fish was 57.2 centimeters fork length and the oldest was 26 years old.\nBased on the available information, the Yellowtail Snapper population was modeled from age 0 through age 26, and from 0 to 56-centimeters fork length, in 1-centimeter bins, with the largest values for each as plus groups.\nNote that SS3 allows the length bins of the data inputs to be larger than the bins used in the population model. The size bins of all the length data inputs were 3 centimeters, the model’s simulated population bin size was 1-centimeter bins. When the population is modeled at a higher resolution concerning bin size, the likelihood function, which aims to match the observed data inputs and the simulated population estimates, operates at the resolution of the data inputs.\n\n2.3.1 Growth\nThe SS3 growth formulation requires five parameters:\n\nLength at the youngest age\nLength at the maximum age\nVon Bertalanffy growth parameter (K)\nCoefficient of variation at the youngest age\nCoefficient of variation at the maximum age\n\nParameter estimates for Von Bertalanffy growth parameter (K) and the length at maximum age (L∞) were based on 1,554 samples of Yellowtail Snapper collected across the U.S. Caribbean from 2013 to 2023 (Shervette et al., 2024). When t0 was fixed to -0.96, K was 0.23, and L∞ was 42.4 centimeters fork length. When t0 was estimated, it was -2.73, K was 0.12, and L∞ was 50.8 centimeters fork length.\nThe SEDAR 84 assessment models were configured using the parameter estimates associated with the fixed t0. Furthermore, the estimated size at age zero from otolith analysis by Shervette et al. (2024) was modified in Stock Synthesis so that the length of the youngest age, age 0, was set to zero. Without this modification, the model would be unable to fit the substantial amounts of small (&lt;10cm) Yellowtail Snapper observed in the survey size composition data.\nCoefficients of variation for both younger and older ages were initially set to 0.15. Ideally, growth coefficients of variation should be derived from observed length-at-age data, however, the assumed values are consistent with species of moderate growth variability.\nAlternative model configurations associated with the growth data are described later in this report. They included:\n\nA higher growth coefficient of variation of 0.25 for younger ages was explored via sensitivity analysis.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Morphometric Conversion\nThe relationship between weight in grams and length in millimeters provided by Shervette et al. (2024) was converted to weight in grams and length in centimeters and used as a fixed model input. The length-weight relationship was W = 2.93 x 10-5 * L2.8642, with weight (W) in kilograms and length (L) in centimeters.\n\n\n2.3.3 Maturity, Fecundity, and Hermaphroditism\nMaturity was modeled as a logistic function. Parameter estimates for maturity were based on 1,876 samples of Yellowtail Snapper collected across the U.S. Caribbean from 2013 to 2023 (Shervette et al., 2024). The fecundity of Yellowtail Snapper was estimated with a proxy (body weight * maturity at age).\n\n\n2.3.4 Stock Recruitment\nA Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function was used to parametrize the relationship between spawning output and resulting recruitment of age-0 fish. The stock-recruit function requires three parameters:\n\nSteepness (h) characterizes the initial slope of the ascending limb (i.e., the fraction of recruits produced at 20% of the unfished spawning biomass).\nThe virgin recruitment (R0; estimated in log space) represents the asymptote or unfished recruitment levels.\nThe variance term (sigma R) is the standard deviation of the log of recruitment and describes the amount of year-to-year variation in recruitment.\n\nOnly the virgin recruitment (R0) was estimated. Sigma R and steepness were fixed at 0.7 and 0.99, respectively. The 0.7 sigma R reflects slightly high variation in recruitment. A value of 0.6 is a moderate level of recruitment variability, with lower values indicating lower variability and more predictable year-to-year recruitment. The primary assumption for steepness was that this stock is not a closed population, so recruitment may not be strongly tied to the local spawning stock biomass. In initial model configurations, annual deviations from the stock-recruit function were not estimated. Steepness and R0 were explored via likelihood profiling.\nContinuous recruitment was parameterized in SS3 using four settlement events. Equal proportions of recruits were assigned to each settlement event, and they were spaced such that recruitment would happen in months 1, 4, 7, and 10. This allowed growth to be staggered, reflecting a closer approximation of the observed stock dynamic of year-round spawning activity.\n\n\n2.3.5 Maximum Age and Natural Mortality\nEmpirical estimates of natural mortality (M) can be derived using life history information such as longevity, growth, and maturity. For this assessment, the Natural Mortality Tool was used to estimate M (Cope & Hamel, 2022). Various methods were explored, incorporating factors such as maximum age, the Von Bertalanffy growth parameter (K), theoretical age at size zero (t0), asymptotic size (L∞), and age at 50% maturity.\nInputs for the Natural Mortality Tool were sourced from Shervette et al. (2024), who observed a maximum age of 26 years for Yellowtail Snapper in the U.S. Caribbean. However, the average age of 1,554 sampled fish was 5 years.\nTable 7.2 summarizes the empirical methods used to estimate M based on available life history data. The primary approach for determining natural mortality in this assessment was longevity-based (Hamel & Cope, 2022).\nA natural mortality value of 0.208 was used in the initial model runs. This value corresponds with the maximum age of 26 years reported by Shervette et al. (2024). Model configurations incorporating an alternative M value associated with a slightly higher maximum age were explored through sensitivity analyses, which are discussed later in this report.",

    "text": "3.1 Framework\nStock Synthesis V3.30.22 was the modeling approach applied in the current SEDAR 84 assessment because of compatibility with the available data and consistency with standard practices.\nStock Synthesis is a statistical catch-at-age model that uses a population model, an observation model, and an estimation model and applies a likelihood function in the estimation process (Methot et al., 2020). Stock Synthesis, commonly referred to as SS3, has been applied extensively worldwide for stock assessment evaluations (Methot & Wetzel, 2013). It has also been used for previous data-limited and data-moderate SEDAR assessments, including the SEDAR 57 assessments and subsequent updates for Caribbean Spiny Lobster (Panulirus argus), and the SEDAR 80 assessments for Queen Triggerfish (Balistes vetula) (SEDAR, 2019, 2022).\nThe Stock Synthesis modeling framework is a compatible tool for SEDAR stock assessments in the U.S. Caribbean because it can accommodate a wide range of model complexities, from data-limited to highly detailed assessments (Cope, 2024). Stock Synthesis allows for the characterization of stock, fishing fleet, and survey dynamics through various parameters, which can be either fixed based on external data or estimated when sufficient assessment data are available. Additionally, it can incorporate complex biological dynamics, such as continuous recruitment, which is appropriate for accurately assessing Puerto Rico Yellowtail Snapper.\nFinally, R packages such as r4ss and ss3diags facilitate critical evaluations of model reliability and model comparisons (Carvalho et al., 2021; Taylor et al., 2021). For example, R4SS provides visualization and diagnostic tools to summarize and interpret fit, convergence, and key output metrics. SS3diags focuses on retrospective analyses, hind-casting, and residual pattern evaluations. The integration of these tools allows rigorous uncertainty analysis, streamlined sensitivity analyses, and enhanced transparency in decision-making.\nStock Synthesis models were initially configured using an annual commercial catch time series and size compositions data that were aggregated across the available years for each source of length data. Model development proceeded stepwise from the simplest configuration to those of moderate complexity.",

    "section": "3.2 Overview",
    "text": "3.2 Overview\nThe SEDAR 84 model development process started with simple data-limited configurations, followed by exploring data-moderate configurations, individually and combined. The simplest configurations aggregated length compositions across years by implementing the super-period approach in Stock Synthesis. When using super-periods, the estimation model generates annual values, but the likelihood function will compare the expected composite to the data composite across the super-period. When using this approach on the size composition data, Stock Synthesis models will still aim to identify parameter values for selectivity that achieve a fit between the predicted and observed data.\nThe initial setup steps and description of the modeling scenarios documented in this report are listed in Table 7.3. For the SEDAR 84 Yellowtail Snapper assessment, the data-moderate considerations explored included: (a) indices of abundance, (b) annual fishery-independent size compositions, (c) annual fishery-dependent size compositions, (d) dome-shaped selectivity, (e) recruitment deviations, and (f) fishery-dependent selectivity time blocks. Additional model configurations were not pursued.\nThe Stock Assessment Continuum Tool was used to develop the initial model setup by importing CSV input files and utilizing its Shiny application interface Cope (2024). Starting from the Continuum Tool (ct) model, a series of sequential modifications were applied to represent three key biological and data-related complexities: adjusted size at age zero (m1), continuous recruitment (m2), and increased catch uncertainty (m3).\nThis report focuses on the results and sensitivities associated with the m3 models, evaluated under the various data configurations summarized in sec-data-summary. While a full discussion of sensitivity runs is provided later in the report, they are also summarized in Table 7.3 to help familiarize the reader with the terminology used throughout. For instance, model v08_m3_s1 refers to the eighth scenario (v8, which includes an index, annual fishery-independent size compositions, and dome-shaped selectivity), the third level modification (m3, reflecting continuous recruitment and higher catch uncertainty), and the fist sensitivity scenario (s1, higher uncertainty on growth).\nDue to the lack of an estimable spawner-recruit relationship across the explored models, a commonly used 40% spawning potential ratio (SPR) was used as a proxy for Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) and as the basis for management reference points. The SPR proxy reflects the ratio of expected lifetime reproductive potential under fished conditions compared to virgin conditions.\n\n\n\n\nCarvalho, F., Winker, H., Courtney, D., Kapur, M., Kell, L., Cardinale, M., Schirripa, M., Kitakado, T., Yemane, D., Piner, K.

    "text": "4.1 Convergence\nModel diagnostics aimed to follow the conceptual process described by Carvalho et al. (2021). Their approach includes evaluating goodness of fit, information sources and structure, prediction skill, convergence, and model plausibility. Although Carvalho et al. (2021) advise detours and additional model explorations when initial diagnostic tests fail, advanced diagnostics, such as likelihood profiles, retrospective, and jitter analyses, were conducted even when initial tests failed to comprehensively communicate the various model configurations explored to the extent possible.\nThree approaches were used to check for model convergence. They were investigating for the presence of (1) bounded parameters, (2) high final gradients, and (3) a positive definite hessian. As described by Carvalho et al. (2021) checking for bounded parameters can indicate discrepancies with data or model structure. Additionally, small final gradients and a positive definite hessian can indicate that the objective function achieved good convergence.\nThe models presented in this report all had a positive definite Hessian, indicating that each reached a local minimum and a locally optimal fit. None of the models had parameters that were bounded, suggesting the optimization was not constrained by parameter limits. Finally, the parameter gradients in all models were small and well below 0.001, which is commonly used in the R4SS R package to identify large gradients (Table 7.7).",

    "text": "4.2 Correlation Analysis\nHigh correlation among parameters can lead to flat response surfaces and poor model stability. By performing a correlation analysis, modeling assumptions that lead to inadequate configurations can be identified. Because of the highly parameterized nature of stock assessment models, some parameters are expected to be correlated (e.g., stock recruit parameters). However, many strongly correlated parameters suggest reconsidering modeling assumptions and parameterization.\nHigh correlations (correlation coefficients greater than 0.95 or less than -0.95) were observed between selectivity parameters for the v08_m2, v28_m2, v28_m3, and v31_m3 (Table 7.4). One particularly noteworthy correlation was between the estimates of initial fishing mortality (Initial F) and unfished recruitment (R0) in model v19_m2.\nIn the initial default configurations of both the m1 and m2 model scenarios, the standard error on the initial equilibrium catch was fixed at a low value of 0.01. This tightly constrained the model to the input catch of 168.3 metric tons effectively limiting flexibility in estimating the corresponding initial fishing mortality. To address this issue, the standard error was increased to 0.3, allowing the estimated initial catch to diverge from the fixed input value (Table 7.6). This adjustment reduced the overly strong correlation between Initial F and R0 by relaxing the constraint on initial fishing mortality. The effects of increasing the standard error beyond 0.3 are discussed further in the sensitivity analyses section.\nAll model scenarios showed moderate or high correlations between the parameters used to define the some of the selectivity parameters, except 19_v3. Correlations between these selectivity parameters is expected. While estimated values varied slightly among models, they produced similar size-based selectivity curves for the commercial fleet (Figure 8.1). Time blocks applied in model v28_m3 and v31_m3 resulted with lower peaks in the first block (1983-2003), higher peak in the second block (2004-2010) for the commercial selectivity pattern. The selectivity for the NCRMP survey differed between across the models, particularly with regard to the end selectivity. These differences, in addition to the correlations NCRMP selectivity parameters, highlight that the estimated parameters informing the NCRMP selectivity relationship are not strongly informed by the available data.",

Table 7.7 presents the model-estimated values and standard deviations for the main active parameters. While it’s important to consider the scale of each parameter, the results suggest that various parameters are being estimated with unusually high precision (less than 0.1). However, four parameters have large coefficients (greater than 0.3) including the initial fishing mortality, the NCRMP ascending selectivity, the NCRMP end selectivity and the NCRMP top selectivity.\nFigure 8.3 illustrates how the estimates and uncertainty for the unfished recruitment (R0) and virgin spawning stock biomass change throughout the sequential steps of model development. In general, increasing the complexity of the model results in wider distributions, particularly for the models with the annual fishery dependent data (v28_m3, and v31_m3) and recruitment deviations estimated (v19_m3 and v31_m3). The uncertainty across the response surface for key parameters is further examined later in the report using likelihood profiles.\nStock Synthesis also provides estimates and standard deviations for derived quantities such as unfished spawning stock biomass, initial year spawning biomass, and the initial depletion. Initial depletion is defined as the initial biomass divided by the unfished biomass. Table 7.5 shows this information and it is also plotted in Figures 8.4 (a) and 8.4 (b).\nCompared to the other m3 model scenarios, Model v28_m3 had the lowest initial depletion reflected as the highest spawning biomass ratio (SSB Initial/SSB Unfished) (Table 7.5 and Figure 8.4).

    "text": "4.4 Jitter Analysis\nJitter analysis is a relatively simple method that can be used to assess model stability and to determine whether the search algorithm has found a global, as opposed to local, solution. The premise is that all starting values are randomly altered (or ‘jittered’) by an input constant value, and the model is rerun from the new starting values. If the resulting population trajectories across many runs converge to the same solution, this provides support that a global minimum has been obtained. This process is not fault-proof; no guarantee can ever be made that the ‘true’ solution has been found or that the model does not contain misspecification. However, if the jitter analysis results are consistent, it provides additional support that the model is performing well and has come to a stable solution. For this assessment, a jitter value of 0.2 was applied to the starting values, and 30 runs were completed. The jitter value defines a uniform distribution in cumulative normal space to generate new initial parameter values (Methot et al., 2020).\nConsistent with earlier results indicating that the models reached local minima (positive definite Hessian), no jitter runs produced a lower likelihood than the best fit already identified for each model. However, with models frequently converging at higher likelihoods, the jitter analysis suggests some instability in the model scenarios (Figure 8.5).\nComparing the Spawning stock biomass over time and the selectivity patterns across the jitter runs reveals that the jittered runs resulted on different NCRMP selectivity patterns (fig-jitter-ssb and fig-jitter-selectivity).",

    "section": "4.5 Residual Analysis",
    "text": "4.5 Residual Analysis\nThe primary approach to investigate model performance was a residual analysis of model fit to each data set (e.g., catch, length compositions, indices). Any temporal trend in model residuals or disproportionately high residual values can indicate model misspecification and poor performance. Ideally, residuals are randomly distributed, conform to the assumed error structure for that data source, and are not of extreme magnitude. Any extremely positive or negative residual patterns indicate poor model performance and potential unaccounted-for process or observation error.\n\n4.5.1 Catch\nAll models closely matched the observed 2012 - 2022 catch data, which was expected given the data-limited configurations used. These setups don’t provide much additional information beyond the catch itself, so the model has little room to estimate catch values that differ from the input data. The effect of increasing the standard error on the initial equilibrium catch to 0.3 during the model development m3 scenario was to give the model more flexibility in estimating initial equilibrium catch and corresponding initial fishing mortality. This adjustment allowed the model to explore alternative fits while remaining informed by the assumed input level of historically sustained catch. Increasing the standard error from 0.01 to 0.3 resulted in higher estimates of the initial equilibrium catch across all models, except v19 (Table 7.6). This topic will be revisited in the sensitivity analyses, where model runs with even higher catch standard error of 2 are compared. Additional justifications for further allowing the estimated initial equilibrium catch to differ from the assumed initial equilibrium catch of 168.3 metric tons is further investigated via likelihood profiles (See Section 4.7.2).\n\n\n4.5.2 Indices\nFor the models without recruitment deviation being estimated (a_m2, v01_m2, and v8_m2 and v28_m3), the predicted NCRMP index is flat or shows a slight increase (Figure 8.8). In the model scenarios with estimated recruitment deviations (v19_m3 and v31_m2), there is only a slightly improved fit to the index capturing a slight increase over time. Notably, high uncertainty in the index was observed in 2021 of the NCRMP index (Figure 8.8).\n\n\n4.5.3 Length Compositions\nFigure 8.11 shows the cumulative fit across all years between the observed and predicted length composition by fleet for each model. Figure 8.12 shows the annual Person residuals by fleet for each model. Figure 8.13 provides the year-specific NRMP survey length compositions for the model scenarios that included annual fishery-independent size data (v01_m3, v08_m3, v19_m3, v28_m3, and v31_m3). Figures 8.14 and 8.15 provide th year-specific length compositions for the model scenarios that included annual fishery-dependent size data (v28_m3, and v31_m3).\nAmong the models with the annual fishery-independent size data (v01_m3, v08_m3, v19_m3, v28_m3, and v31_m3), the models with recruitment deviation being estimated (v19_m3 and v31_m2), has improved fits to the annual NCRMP length composition data (Figure 8.11). In the scenarios without recruitment deviations, the predicted NCRMP composition is identical across years and similar to cumulative fit when the size data were aggregated in model a_m3. Figure 8.9 shows the observed and predicted mean length by year. In the model scenarios with estimated recruitment deviations (v19_m3 and v31_m2), there is an improved fit to the mean length capturing an increase over time.\nAmong the models with the annual fishery-dependent size data (v28_m3, and v31_m3), the model with recruitment deviation being estimated (v31_m3), has improved fits to the commercial length composition data (Figure 8.11). Finally, Figure 8.10 shows the observed and predicted mean length by year. In the model scenarios with estimated recruitment deviations (v19_m3 and v31_m2), there is decreased error and an improved fit to the mean length capturing an increase over time.",

    "text": "4.6 Retrospective Analysis\nA retrospective analysis is a helpful approach for investigating the consistency of terminal year model estimates (e.g., SSB, Recruits, Fs) and is often considered a sensitivity exploration of impacts on key parameters from changes in data. The analysis sequentially removes a year of data and reruns the model. Suppose the resulting estimates of derived quantities such as SSB or recruitment differ significantly. In such a case, serial over- or underestimation of important quantities can indicate that the model has an unidentified process error and could require reassessing model assumptions. It is expected that removing data will lead to slight differences between the new terminal year estimates and the estimates for that year in the model with the complete time series of data. Estimates in years before the terminal year may have increasingly reliable information on cohort strength. Therefore, slight differences are usually expected between model runs as more years of size composition data are sequentially removed. Ideally, the difference in estimates will be slight and randomly distributed above and below the estimates from the model with complete data set time series.\nThe results of a five-year retrospective analysis are plotted in Figure 8.16 and Figure 8.17. All retrospectives show wide 95% confidence intervals. The retrospective pattern was most divergent in the scenarios with recruitment deviations and annual fishery-independent size data, model v31_m2. The model v19_m3 retrospective is also unusual as the models ending in 2019 and 2020 reflect an entirely different pattern overt the time series, with drastically different estimates for initial fishing mortality.",

    "text": "4.7 Likelihood Profiles\nProfile likelihoods are used to assess the stability of parameter estimates by examining changes in the negative log-likelihood for each data source and evaluating the influence of each source on the estimate. The analysis is performed by holding a given parameter at a constant value and rerunning the model. The model is run repeatedly over a range of reasonable parameter values. Ideally, the graph of change in likelihood values against parameter values will yield a well-defined minimum. When the profile plot shows conflicting signals or is flat across its range, the given parameter may be poorly estimated.\nTypically, profiling is carried out for key parameters, particularly those defining the stock-recruit relationship (steepness, virgin recruitment, and sigma R). Profiles were explored across virgin recruitment (R0), initial equilibrium catch, and steepness.\n\n4.7.1 Unfished Recruitment (R0)\nFigure 8.18 shows the profile likelihood for the natural log of the unfished recruitment parameter of the Beverton – Holt stock-recruit function for Puerto Rico Yellowtail Snapper across models. All models show relatively poorly defined minimums, with a range of equally plausible values reflected by only small changes in likelihood. However, with the current plots in the report, this is difficult to notice due to the large y-axis scale due to runs that converged at much higher likelihoods. Figure 8.19 shows the corresponding change in the Maximum Sustainable Yield Proxy based on SPR 40% across the range of unfished recruitment values explored. Across the range of R0 values explored (0.7 to 1.3 times the estimated R0 for each respective model), the estimates of the MSY proxy (based on SPR 40%) range between 100 and 300 metric tons and reflect a positive relationship with R0 (higher R0 values are associated with higher estimates of the MSY proxy).\n\n\n4.7.2 Initial Equilibrium Catch\nFigure 8.20 shows the profile likelihood for the initial equilibrium catch for Puerto Rico Yellowtail Snapper across model scenarios. The models, with the exception of v19_m3 and v28_m3, suggest improved fit around 200 metric tons of fixed initial equilibrium catch. Model v19_m3 suggests that given further flexibility the initial equilibrium may be estimated lower. This was further examined through sensitivity runs further relaxing the information that informs the initial model conditions. Figure 8.21 shows the corresponding change in the MSY SPR 40% across the range of initial equilibrium catch values explored.\n\n\n4.7.3 Steepness\nFigure 8.22 shows the profile likelihood for the steepness parameter of the Beverton – Holt stock-recruit function for Puerto Rico Yellowtail Snapper across models. The lowest likelihoods are not associated with the highest values of steepness. Instead they are assoicated with intermediatly steepness values between 0.7 and 0.9. Figure 8.23 shows the corresponding change in the MSY SPR 40% across the range of steepness values explored.",

    "text": "4.8 Sensitivity Runs\nSensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of key model assumptions on derived quantities. Details of the process and naming conventions are provided in Table 7.3. The analyses explored alternative assumptions for the CV on growth, fixed input for maximum age-informed mortality, and the standard error applied to catch data.\nFor each model scenario and sensitivity run:\n\nTable 7.6 provides the initial equilibrium catch\nTables 7.8 and 7.9 provide the MSY proxy (based on SPR 40%)\nTable 7.10 summarizes the fishing mortality rate and spawning stock biomass ratios relative to the rate and biomass of the stock associated with the MSY proxy (based on SPR 40%)\n\n\n4.8.1 Growth CV\nThe first sensitivity scenario (s1) assumed coefficient of variation (CV) for young fish was increased from 0.15 to 0.25. The m3_s1 sensitivities resulted in a slight increase to estimated initial equilibrium catch relative to the corresponding m3 sensitivity model configurations (Tables 7.6, 7.8, 7.9, and 7.10). Growth is a critical process in all stock assessment models, and in this assessment, the CV for young fish was a particularly relevant sensitivity to examine due to the large number of small individuals (less than 8 cm) observed in the NCRMP fishery-independent survey length compositions. While additional sensitivities related to growth were considered, they will be revisited in the discussion section as part of the research recommendations. The current models use the best available growth parameters from Shervette et al. (2024).\n\n\n4.8.2 Natural Mortality\nThe second sensitivity scenario (s2) explored a slightly lower natural mortality of 0.193, corresponding to a higher maximum age of 28 years. This higher maximum age, is only slightly older than the maximum age of 26 years observed by Shervette et al. (2024). Although the true maximum age is often larger than the maximum age observed, particularly for species that have sustained historical fishing pressure, the Hamel (2015) method estimates natural mortality based on the maximum observed age. In this assessment, age is the only factor used to inform the estimate of natural mortality, making it important to consider the implications of assuming a lower M, which reflects a less productive stock. The m3_s2 sensitivity models were similar to the corresponding m3 configurations (Tables 7.6, 7.8, 7.9, and 7.10).\n\n\n4.8.3 Standard Error on Catch\nThe third sensitivity scenario (s3) examined the effect of further relaxing the information that informs the initial model conditions. In the m3 model scenarios, a standard error of 0.3 was applied to the landings data (see Section 2.1.1). Compared to the m2 model scenarios, this resulted in higher estimates of initial equilibrium catch, except for model v19_m3. The likelihood profiles (see Section 4.7.2) for v19_m3 showed improved fit at even lower fixed estimates of equilibrium catch. This led to the exploration of increased input uncertainty using a standard error of 2.0 associated with the input equilibrium catch.\nEffectively, this provides greater flexibility in estimating initial conditions. The s3 sensitivities produced similar estimates as the corresponding m2 models except for model v19a_m3_s3 which had slightly lower initial catch, slightly higher yield (Tables 7.6, 7.8, 7.9, and 7.10).\nThese results highlight the significance of uncertainty in initial conditions. This sensitivity underscores the value of longer historical data series. Without them, there is considerable uncertainty in defining the initial conditions, and the m3_s3 results imply that if early landings were larger than assumed in the m3 models, the stock may be inherently more productive.\n\n\n4.8.4 Standard Error on Catch and Natural Mortality\nThe fourth sensitivity scenario (s4) explored the combined implications of two sensitivities: increased uncertainty around initial equilibrium catch and lower natural mortality associated with higher maximum age. By evaluating both assumptions simultaneously, this scenario investigates the compounding uncertainty associated with the baseline m3 model configurations.\nThe combined effect of these changes were similar to the third sensitivity scenario exploring only the standard error on catch, except for model v19_m2_s4 (Tables 7.6, 7.8, 7.9, and 7.10). Model v19_m2_s4 resulted in the highest fishing mortality ratio (2.02) and lowest biomass ratio (0.36) across all models documented in this report.\n\n\n\n\nCarvalho, F., Winker, H., Courtney, D., Kapur, M., Kell, L., Cardinale, M., Schirripa, M., Kitakado, T., Yemane, D., Piner, K.

    "text": "This assessment presents a series of model configurations developed to address key uncertainties in both the data and model structure, using an integrated framework to evaluate the stock status of Yellowtail Snapper in Puerto Rico. Across the wide range of scenarios explored, two of the model configurations (v19a and v31a) indicate that the stock could be overfished and that overfishing could be occurring (Table 7.10). However, diagnostics and sensitivity analyses revealed important caveats, primarily due to the strong influence of fixed parameter assumptions including uncertainty initial conditions and the final value of the dome-shaped NCRMP index.\nA major source of uncertainty stems from unknown initial catch levels, which are strongly tied to the resulting levels of sustainable yield. Because these dynamics remain confounded we strongly recommend either extending the catch history if a reliable catch time series extending back to the unexploited state is available or exploring methods that decouple the estimation of initial fishing mortality and starting year depletion level.\nAmong all sensitivity analyses, assumptions about historical catch levels had the greatest influence on model outcomes. Although not yet explored as a sensitivity in the current assessment, the models indicates that the interpretation of stock status is sensitive to the shape and extent of the NCRMP dome-shaped selectivity. These results highlight the importance of structured sensitivity testing to better understand how uncertainty affects model results. Future research should explore the use of model grids or ensemble approaches to formally incorporate uncertainty and improve the reliability of management advice.\nGrowth is a key biological input that influences estimates of stock productivity and selectivity. In this assessment, the size of Yellowtail Snapper observed by the Trip Interview Program, and used to inform the commercial fleet’s selectivity, suggest that the estimated average size at maximum age may be too low. Alternative growth curves should be considered, potentially by incorporating broader regional data sets and accounting for the size and age distribution of samples when refitting growth. Since maximum observed sizes appear comparable across regions (SEDAR (2020)), revisiting the growth parameter inputs could strengthen the biological realism and performance of future assessments.\nRecruitment deviations, when estimated, were particularly uncertain. However, the availability of fishery-independent length data from the NCRMP survey provides a valuable information source. The observed abundance of small fish may allow better inference of recruitment in future assessments. Finer resolution data (e.g., using 1 cm bins for specific years) could improve model performance and reduce uncertainty.\nIntegrated models such as Stock Synthesis are powerful not only for synthesizing multiple data sources but also for making key assumptions explicit and testable. Without this flexibility, assessments risk producing outputs that must be taken at face value, with little opportunity to evaluate the effects of underlying assumptions.\nWhile not every species will have sufficient data for an integrated assessment, wherever possible, structured scenario testing should be pursued to explore alternative hypotheses and better understand the drivers of population dynamics. Such efforts strengthen the scientific foundation for management advice and help balance the need for both rigorous and practical assessment frameworks.\nThis assessment assumes an open population with recruitment not tightly linked to local spawning stock. This assumption could benefit from future exploration of regional connectivity, as it has implications for both model structure and management scale. If connectivity across islands is strong, larger-scale stock definitions or spatially explicit metapopulation modeling approaches may be warranted.\nFinally, the stepwise modeling approach used in this assessment offers a framework that could be applied to other Caribbean species. Expanding the approach through targeted data collection and method development could improve the timeliness and robustness of stock assessments across the region. This will require continued support for long-term monitoring programs, higher-resolution data collection, and investment in model development and bridging exercises to deliver science-based, real-time management advice.\n\n\n\n\nSEDAR.

Collect and analyze additional life history data to evaluate the accuracy around growth and natural mortality rates.\nConduct focused research on historical catches and fishing history to inform and constrain early model conditions.\nConsider using simpler production models or age-structured models with fixed selectivity to isolate and evaluate different data inputs.\nDevelop and evaluate model ensembles or uncertainty grids to guide catch advice under different plausible scenarios.\nInvestigate stock connectivity to better understand local vs. regional recruitment dynamics.\nResearch methods, including simulations, to “right-size” model complexity to match data availability, avoiding overparameterization in data-limited contexts.\nSupport Management Strategy Evaluations that are robust to key uncertainties to guide harvest advice.\nEnsure the continuation of fishery-independent survey programs (e.g., National Coral Reef Monitoring Program) with consistent spatial and temporal coverage.\nMaintain and expand commercial catch monitoring programs. Expand port sampling and other fishery-dependent data collection to fill gaps in length composition and effort data.\nThe use of initial catch in this assessment was intended to inform an initial starting depletion for the population. However, model evaluations show it also strongly informs maximum sustainable yield estimates. This is an undesirable outcome and additional research into how to decouple these impacts would significantly improve model result reliability.\nInvestigate data on the sizes of discarded fish to inform size-based retention. Explore parameterizing retention to improve selectivity of the commercial fleet and interpret the apparent high selectivity of larger individuals that are poorly estimated by the current models.",
