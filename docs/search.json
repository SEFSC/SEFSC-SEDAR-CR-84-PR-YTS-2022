    "text": "Assessment Process Report Summary\nThe SEDAR 84 Puerto Rico Yellowtail Snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus) stock assessment process consisted of four webinars between April 2024 and October 2024. The data available for the assessment included:\n\nAn annual species-specific catch time series from commercial logbooks\nFishery-dependent length compositions from commercial port sampling\nFishery-independent length compositions from a reef fish survey\nFishery-independent indices of abundance from a reef fish survey\nLife history information from otolith analysis and gonad histology\n\nThe assessment used Stock Synthesis, a statistical catch-at-age model (Methot et al., 2020). Stock Synthesis V3.30.22 models were initially configured with an annual catch time series, while length composition data from each source were aggregated across all available years. Model development proceeded stepwise from the simplest configuration to those of moderate complexity. Those sequential steps included the inclusion of dome-shaped selectivity, indices of abundance, and annual length compositions. Models were run with and without the estimation of recruitment deviations. Finally, sensitivities of assessment outcomes were investigated using alternative inputs for longevity-informed natural mortality, coefficient of variation on growth, and uncertainty on initial equilibrium catch.\nModel diagnostics assessed convergence, fit, and consistency using gradients, residuals, likelihood profiles, hindcast cross-validation, and jitter analyses. Those diagnostics revealed that, although data contrast was limited and recruitment estimates were highly uncertain, the available length and catch data—particularly from fishery-independent sources—provided information that the models can use to determine potential catch advice, particularly in a grid or model ensemble approach that accounts for key model assumptions and data-limited caveats.\nSensitivity analyses evaluated the effects of assumptions about natural mortality, growth variability, and initial equilibrium catch conditions. While these scenarios showed that key uncertainties can influence estimated productivity and biological reference points, nearly all models across the suite supported the conclusion that overfishing is not occurring and the stock is not overfished. A few sensitivity runs did indicate potential concern under specific combinations of assumptions, particularly with lower initial equilibrium catch and higher natural mortality.\n\n\n\n\nMethot, R.

    "text": "2.1.1 Catch\nThe catch data for the commercial fleet came from the Caribbean Commercial Logbook program (Martínez Rivera et al., 2024). Commercial fishery landings data for Yellowtail Snapper in Puerto Rico were available for the years 1983-2022.\nThe handline gear group made up 80% of the reported landings catch of Yellowtail Snapper in Puerto Rico from this group. All gears (handline, trap, rod and reel, and other) were included into a single commercial fleet (Table 5.1). Potential outliers discussed during the assessment webinars were investigated and retained as valid trips.\nIn the SEDAR 84 Stock Synthesis models, the catch was input as biomass (in metric tons) and was treated as if it occurred over an entire fishing season; i.e., each fishing year.\nThe years of the available species-specific self-reported commercial fisher logbook landings and effort data determined the start and end years of the Stock Synthesis models. The start and end years of the model were 1983 and 2022, respectively.\nIt is important to note that the stock was not unexploited at the start year of the available catch time series. Therefore, initial F was estimated for the commercial fleet and a corresponding initial equilibrium catch was input. A common method was use to define an initial equilibrium catch. It was equal to the geometric mean of the first three years of available catches (168.3 metric tons).\nThe input standard error for the landings was set to 0.3. When implemented with few data inputs, Stock synthesis will inherently fit the annual landings time series nearly exactly, regardless of the input standard error. Initial models were set up with a default standard error of 0.01. In addition to nearly exactly fitting the annual landings time series, the models also nearly exactly fit the input initial equilibrium catch. A higher standard error value of 0.3 was used to free up the estimation of the initial equilibrium catch. The sequential model configurations and model development are described later in this report.\nCommercial discards are not reported in Puerto Rico fisher logbook data. The assessment assumed no discards.\nAlternative model configurations associated with the commercial fleet data are described later in this report. They included:\n\nThe initial equilibrium catch was explored via likelihood profiling.\nA higher standard error of 2 was explored via sensitivity analysis.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Size Composition\nGear-specific annual length frequencies for the commercial fleet came from the commercial shore-based port-sampling Trip Interview Program (Godwin et al., 2024). The NOAA Fisheries, Southeast Fisheries Science Center Trip Interview Program collects length and weight data from fish landed by commercial fishing vessels, along with information about fishing areas and gears. Data collection began in 1983 with frequent updates in best practices; the latest being in 2017. The Yellowtail Snapper length data from Puerto Rico included 103,730 length observations across 5,159 unique port sampling interviews.\nAlthough the catch data can be separated into handline and non-handline related gears, 77% of the length measurements for Puerto Rico Yellowtail Snapper from 1983-2022 were associated with handlines. Those data were used to characterize the commercial fleet’s size-based selectivity pattern. Since multiple fish length measurements can be obtained from a single sampled trip, each length does not represent an independent observation. The relative model weighting of the commercial fleet length compositions was based on the number of trips sampled.\nFrom 1983 - 2022, the size data included 83,341 shore-based length measurements obtained across 2,829 trips. The Trip Interview Program length compositions of the commercial fleet were assumed to be representative of the total catch.\nA double normal function was used to model the relative vulnerability of capture by length for the commercial fleet. However, only two parameters were estimated, effectively describing a logistic selectivity for the commercial fleet. The double normal function allows for domed or logistic selectivity. It combines two normal distributions; the first describes the ascending limb, while the second describes the descending limb. Achieving the logistic shape with the double normal Stock Synthesis pattern facilitated model configurations for SEDAR 84. The two parameters used to achieve a logistic selectivity shape were the size associated with peak selectivity and the width of the ascending limb. Domed selectivity was explored for the fishery independent survey data described in the following section.",

    "section": "2.2 Survey Data",
    "text": "2.2 Survey Data\n\n2.2.1 Index of Abundance\nThe National Coral Reef Monitoring Program (NCRMP) supports reef fish sampling on hard-bottom habitats from 0 to 30 meters depth (Grove et al., 2021). In Puerto Rico, NCRMP sampling began in 2001 and was conducted every year from 2001 to 2012 and then 2014, 2016, 2019, and 2021. The data used in SEDAR 84 were from 2014 - 2022 when the survey was conducted island-wide. Data collected prior to 2017 were calibrated to account for a transition from belt transect to a cylinder survey method.\nAnnual mean density and associated standard errors for NCRMP for SEDAR 84 were provided by Grove et al. (2024). In Stock Synthesis, the time series of mean density across all observed sizes were input as an index in numbers with a lognormal error distribution. The associated length composition data, described in the following subsection, suggested that the index reflected the abundance of juveniles but did not observe the larger adults concurrently observed in the commercial catch data.\n\n\n2.2.2 Size Composition\nThe NCRMP survey in Puerto Rico provided counts by individual lengths measured to the nearest centimeter. The length data inputs for both the commercial fleet and the surveys were used 3-centimeter bins.\nSince multiple fish can be observed during a single dive, individual lengths are not independent observations. The relative model weighting of the NCRMP survey and DCRMP survey length compositions across years was based on the number of paired dives.\nThe length compositions provided reasonable support that younger fish were available to the NCRMP survey. Over half of the lengths from the NCRMP survey were smaller than 20 centimeters fork length, and 99% were below 33 centimeters fork length. Dome-shaped selectivity was explored for the NCRMP survey.\nModels were initially configured in Stock Synthesis with length compositions aggregated across the available years for each source of length data and proceeded stepwise from the simplest configuration to those of moderate complexity. The steps included the inclusion of annual fishery-independent length compositions. The sequential model configurations are described later in this report.",

    "section": "2.3 Life History Data",
    "text": "2.3 Life History Data\nThe life history data used in the assessment included longevity-informed natural mortality, growth, length-weight, and maturity analyzed from 1,554 samples of Yellowtail Snapper collected across the U.S. Caribbean from 2013 to 2023 (Shervette et al., 2024). The largest fish was 57.2 centimeters fork length and the oldest was 26 years old.\nBased on the available information, the Yellowtail Snapper population was modeled from age 0 through age 26, and from 0 to 56-centimeters fork length, in 1-centimeter bins, with the largest values for each as plus groups.\nNote that SS3 allows the length bins of the data inputs to be larger than the bins used in the population model. The size bins of all the length data inputs were 3 centimeters, the model’s simulated population bin size was 1-centimeter bins. When the population is modeled at a higher resolution concerning bin size, the likelihood function, which aims to match the observed data inputs and the simulated population estimates, operates at the resolution of the data inputs.\n\n2.3.1 Growth\nThe SS3 growth formulation requires five parameters:\n\nLength at the youngest age\nLength at the maximum age\nVon Bertalanffy growth parameter (K)\nCoefficient of variation at the youngest age\nCoefficient of variation at the maximum age\n\nParameter estimates for Von Bertalanffy growth parameter (K) and the length at maximum age (L∞) were based on 1,554 samples of Yellowtail Snapper collected across the U.S. Caribbean from 2013 to 2023 (Shervette et al., 2024). When t0 was fixed to -0.96, K was 0.23, and L∞ was 42.4 centimeters fork length. When t0 was estimated, it was -2.73, K was 0.12, and L∞ was 50.8 centimeters fork length.\nThe SEDAR 84 assessment models were configured using the parameter estimates associated with the fixed t0. Furthermore, the estimated size at age zero from otolith analysis by Shervette et al. (2024) was modified in Stock Synthesis so that the length of the youngest age, age 0, was set to zero. Without this modification, the model would be unable to fit the substantial amounts of small (&lt;10cm) Yellowtail Snapper observed in the survey size composition data.\nCoefficients of variation for both younger and older ages were initially set to 0.15. Ideally, growth coefficients of variation should be derived from observed length-at-age data, however, the assumed values are consistent with species of moderate growth variability.\nAlternative model configurations associated with the growth data are described later in this report. They included:\n\nA higher growth coefficient of variation of 0.25 for younger ages was explored via sensitivity analysis.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Morphometric Conversion\nThe relationship between weight in grams and length in millimeters provided by Shervette et al. (2024) was converted to weight in grams and length in centimeters and used as a fixed model input. The length-weight relationship was W = 2.93 x 10-5 * L2.8642, with weight (W) in kilograms and length (L) in centimeters.\n\n\n2.3.3 Maturity, Fecundity, and Hermaphroditism\nMaturity was modeled as a logistic function. Parameter estimates for maturity were based on 1,876 samples of Yellowtail Snapper collected across the U.S. Caribbean from 2013 to 2023 (Shervette et al., 2024). The fecundity of Yellowtail Snapper was estimated with a proxy (body weight * maturity at age).\n\n\n2.3.4 Stock Recruitment\nA Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function was used to parametrize the relationship between spawning output and resulting recruitment of age-0 fish. The stock-recruit function requires three parameters:\n\nSteepness (h) characterizes the initial slope of the ascending limb (i.e., the fraction of recruits produced at 20% of the unfished spawning biomass).\nThe virgin recruitment (R0; estimated in log space) represents the asymptote or unfished recruitment levels.\nThe variance term (sigma R) is the standard deviation of the log of recruitment and describes the amount of year-to-year variation in recruitment.\n\nOnly the virgin recruitment (R0) was estimated. Sigma R and steepness were fixed at 0.7 and 0.99, respectively. The 0.7 sigma R reflects slightly high variation in recruitment. A value of 0.6 is a moderate level of recruitment variability, with lower values indicating lower variability and more predictable year-to-year recruitment. The primary assumption for steepness was that this stock is not a closed population, so recruitment may not be strongly tied to the local spawning stock biomass. In initial model configurations, annual deviations from the stock-recruit function were not estimated. Steepness and R0 were explored via likelihood profiling.\nContinuous recruitment was parameterized in SS3 using four settlement events. Equal proportions of recruits were assigned to each settlement event, and they were spaced such that recruitment would happen in months 1, 4, 7, and 10. This allowed growth to be staggered, reflecting a closer approximation of the observed stock dynamic of year-round spawning activity.\n\n\n2.3.5 Maximum Age and Natural Mortality\nEmpirical estimates of natural mortality (M) can be derived using life history information such as longevity, growth, and maturity. For this assessment, the Natural Mortality Tool was used to estimate M (Cope & Hamel, 2022). Various methods were explored, incorporating factors such as maximum age, the Von Bertalanffy growth parameter (K), theoretical age at size zero (t0), asymptotic size (L∞), and age at 50% maturity.\nInputs for the Natural Mortality Tool were sourced from Shervette et al. (2024), who observed a maximum age of 26 years for Yellowtail Snapper in the U.S. Caribbean. However, the average age of 1,554 sampled fish was 5 years.\nTable 5.2 summarizes the empirical methods used to estimate M based on available life history data. The primary approach for determining natural mortality in this assessment was longevity-based (Hamel & Cope, 2022).\nA natural mortality value of 0.208 was used in the initial model runs. This value corresponds with the maximum age of 26 years reported by Shervette et al. (2024). Model configurations incorporating an alternative M value associated with a slightly higher maximum age were explored through sensitivity analyses, which are discussed later in this report.",

    "text": "3.1 Framework\nStock Synthesis V3.30.22 was the modeling approach applied in the current SEDAR 84 assessment because of compatibility with the available data and consistency with standard practices.\nStock Synthesis is a statistical catch-at-age model that uses a population model, an observation model, and an estimation model and applies a likelihood function in the estimation process (Methot et al., 2020). Stock Synthesis, commonly referred to as SS3, has been applied extensively worldwide for stock assessment evaluations (Methot & Wetzel, 2013). It has also been used for previous data-limited and data-moderate SEDAR assessments, including the SEDAR 57 assessments and subsequent updates for Caribbean Spiny Lobster (Panulirus argus), and the SEDAR 80 assessments for Queen Triggerfish (Balistes vetula) (SEDAR, 2019, 2022).\nThe Stock Synthesis modeling framework is a compatible tool for SEDAR stock assessments in the U.S. Caribbean because it can accommodate a wide range of model complexities, from data-limited to highly detailed assessments (Cope, 2024). Stock Synthesis allows for the characterization of stock, fishing fleet, and survey dynamics through various parameters, which can be either fixed based on external data or estimated when sufficient assessment data are available. Additionally, it can incorporate complex biological dynamics, such as continuous recruitment, which is appropriate for accurately assessing Puerto Rico Yellowtail Snapper.\nFinally, R packages such as r4ss and ss3diags facilitate critical evaluations of model reliability and model comparisons (Carvalho et al., 2021; Taylor et al., 2021). For example, R4SS provides visualization and diagnostic tools to summarize and interpret fit, convergence, and key output metrics. SS3diags focuses on retrospective analyses, hind-casting, and residual pattern evaluations. The integration of these tools allows rigorous uncertainty analysis, streamlined sensitivity analyses, and enhanced transparency in decision-making.\nStock Synthesis models were initially configured using an annual commercial catch time series and size compositions data that were aggregated across the available years for each source of length data. Model development proceeded stepwise from the simplest configuration to those of moderate complexity.",

    "section": "3.2 Overview",
    "text": "3.2 Overview\nThe SEDAR 84 model development process started with simple data-limited configurations, followed by exploring data-moderate configurations, individually and combined. The simplest configurations aggregated length compositions across years by implementing the super-period approach in Stock Synthesis. When using super-periods, the estimation model generates annual values, but the likelihood function will compare the expected composite to the data composite across the super-period. When using this approach on the size composition data, Stock Synthesis models will still aim to identify parameter values for selectivity that achieve a fit between the predicted and observed data.\nThe initial setup steps and description of the modeling scenarios documented in this report are listed in Table 5.3. For the SEDAR 84 Yellowtail Snapper assessment, the data-moderate considerations explored included: (a) indices of abundance, (b) annual fishery-independent size compositions, (c) annual fishery-dependent size compositions, (d) dome-shaped selectivity, (e) recruitment deviations, and (f) fishery-dependent selectivity time blocks. Additional model configurations were not pursued.\nThe Stock Assessment Continuum Tool was used to develop the initial model setup by importing CSV input files and utilizing its Shiny application interface Cope (2024). Starting from the Continuum Tool (ct) model, a series of sequential modifications were applied to represent three key biological and data-related complexities: adjusted size at age zero (m1), continuous recruitment (m2), and increased catch uncertainty (m3).\nThis report focuses on the results and sensitivities associated with the m3 models, evaluated under the various data configurations summarized in sec-data-summary. While a full discussion of sensitivity runs is provided later in the report, they are also summarized in Table 5.3 to help familiarize the reader with the terminology used throughout. For instance, model v08_m3_s1 refers to the eighth scenario (v8, which includes an index, annual fishery-independent size compositions, and dome-shaped selectivity), the third level modification (m3, reflecting continuous recruitment and higher catch uncertainty), and the fist sensitivity scenario (s1, higher uncertainty on growth).\nDue to the lack of an estimable spawner-recruit relationship across the explored models, a commonly used 40% spawning potential ratio (SPR) was used as a proxy for Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) and as the basis for management reference points. The SPR proxy reflects the ratio of expected lifetime reproductive potential under fished conditions compared to virgin conditions.\n\n\n\n\nCarvalho, F., Winker, H., Courtney, D., Kapur, M., Kell, L., Cardinale, M., Schirripa, M., Kitakado, T., Yemane, D., Piner, K.

    "text": "To mitigate some of the data uncertainties it is recommended to:\n\nExpand fishery-independent survey time series and resolution (e.g., retain and use 1-cm length bin data where available).\nFurther evaluate natural mortality and growth assumptions. Collect and analyze additional life history data to evaluate the accuracy around growth and natural mortality rates.\nConduct focused research on historical catches and fishing history to inform and constrain early model conditions.\nConsider using simpler production models or age-structured models with fixed selectivity to isolate and evaluate different data inputs.\nDevelop and evaluate model ensembles or uncertainty grids to guide catch advice under different plausible scenarios.\nInvestigate stock connectivity to better understand local vs. regional recruitment dynamics.\nResearch methods, including simulations, to “right-size” model complexity to match data availability, avoiding overparameterization in data-limited contexts.\nSupport Management Strategy Evaluations that are robust to key uncertainties to guide harvest advice.\nEnsure the continuation of fishery-independent survey programs (e.g., National Coral Reef Monitoring Program) with consistent spatial and temporal coverage.\nMaintain and expand commercial catch monitoring programs. Expand port sampling and other fishery-dependent data collection to fill gaps in length composition and effort data.\nThe use of initial catch in this assessment was intended to inform an initial starting depletion for the population. However, model evaluations show it also strongly informs maximum sustainable yield estimates. This is an undesirable outcome and additional research into how to decouple these impacts would significantly improve model result reliability.\nInvestigate data on the sizes of discarded fish to inform size-based retention. Explore parameterizing retention to improve selectivity of the commercial fleet and interpret the apparent high selectivity of larger individuals that are poorly estimated by the current models.",
